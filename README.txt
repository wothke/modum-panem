modum panem

This is just a little WEBGL experiment of mine: https://www.wothke.ch/modum/#/wright-and-bastard/sets/evoke-2016
(or see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx0Aakv3JPE)

I put the code here not so much for it to be useful to anybody else but so that I have an additional 
backup of the source code.

The page plays music hosted on soundcloud. In order to use the code locally you'll have to put a 
valid soundcloud client ID into the proxy.php script.
